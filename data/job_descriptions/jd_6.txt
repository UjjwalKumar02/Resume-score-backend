Employees are at the heart and center of any company. We believe when people thrive, so do businesses. We empower modern workforces to put people at the forefront and invest in their productivity. Lyearn offers a complete employee success solution to ensure a shared alignment of goals, performance management, increased engagement, and a culture of learning.
We bring tools for OKR management, skill and activity tracking, performance reviews, 1-on-1 communication, continuous feedback and social recognition, employee engagement surveys, and learning management into a single, people-friendly, and customizable platform. Our focus on people enablement, engagement, and decision analysis helps develop employees, accelerate their growth, and improve businesses.
We use React to develop modular and scalable systems, so as to enable us to serve our dynamic requirements around learning and build on top of a neat code structure. We definitely don't expect you to be familiar with everything we use, but strong aptitude and good problem-solving skills, along with knowledge in JavaScript, and ideally React/GoLang would be a plus.
